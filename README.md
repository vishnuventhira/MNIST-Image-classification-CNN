# MNIST-Image-classification-CNN
Performed analysis on Fashion MNIST dataset in keras which has 10 different categories by creating a baseline model as multiple perceptron layer with four hidden layers.
Performed feature standardization, ZCA whitening, data augmentation(random rotation, random shifts, random flips) on CNN model.
Observed CNN is able to patternize better than MLP
